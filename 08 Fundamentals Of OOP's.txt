ANS 01:

           Using new keyword we can create an object:
            <className>  <object name>  =  <new keyword>  <class name()>

         EXAMPLE->

     //   if Student is a class-
       class Student{
   
int age;
String name;    

    public static void main (String[] args){

Student obj = new Student();

 System.out.println(obj.name);
        System.out.println(obj.age);


}

}



ANS 02:
 
* New keyword is used to allocate memory for an object.
* New key word is used to create an instance of the class.
* It creates a java object and allocates memory for it on the heap. 

                     Car obj = new Car();            [Create a Car class Object]



ANS 03:

 Types Of Variables:

-> Static Variables
-> Instance Variable 
-> Local Variable


ANS 04:

Difference between Instance Variable and Local Variable:

*Instance Variable are declared within a class but outside a method ,constructor or block and always get a default value.
*These variables are destroyed when the object is distroyed. 
*It can be accessed throughout the class.  
*They are used to reserving memory for data that the class needs and that too for the lifetime of the object.
*It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use. 
*It includes access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc. 

VS

*Local variables are declared within a method but do not get any dafault value. 
*These variables are destroyed when the constructor or method is exited.
*Its access is limited to the method in which it is declared.
*They are used to decreasing dependencies between components I.e., the complexity of code is decreased.
*It is important to initialize local variables before use.
*It does not include any access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.



ANS 05:

Heap Area memory is allocated for Instance variable and Stack area memory is allocated for Local variable.


Ans 06:

Method Overloading:
Method overloading is a feature in java that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name,but with different parameters.




EXAMPLE: 

class calc{
    public int add (int n1, int n2){   //two parameters

        int result = n1+n2;
        return result;
    }

    public int add (int n1, int n2, int n3){   //three parameters

        int result = n1+n2 +n3;
        return result;
    }

    public double add (double n1, double n2){    //two parameters

        double result = n1+n2;
        return result;
    }
}


public class MethOvld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        calc obj = new calc();

        int result =  obj.add(4,3);
        int result1 =  obj.add(4,3,8);
        double result2 = obj.add(6.9 ,6.9);

        System.out.println(result);
        System.out.println(result1);
        System.out.println(result2);


    }
}
