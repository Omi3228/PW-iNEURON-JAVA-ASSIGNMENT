                                        Array in Java & Concepts-02 [Assignment Questions/Answers]     02 Febâ€™23

ANS 01:

Default Array values in Java:

boolean -> false
int -> 0
double -> 0.0 
String -> null
User-Defined type -> null


ANS 02:

No,You can't use a negative integer as a size, the size of an array represents the number of elements in it.
still if you do so, the program gets compiled without issues but, while  executing it generates a runtime exception of type "NegativeArraySizeException"

Example:

Public class Test{

public static void main(String[] args){

int []a = new int[-3];
System.out.println(a);

     }
}


output-> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -3
	at Arrays.ArrrayIndexOutOfBoundExceptions.main(ArrrayIndexOutOfBoundExceptions.java:33)




ANS 03:

Array stored in heap memory or heap area in JVM.
In java reference types are stored in the heap area.as arrays are also reference types,(they can be created using the "new" keyword ) the are also stored in the Heap area.



ANS 04:

There are some disadvantages of array-
* Once we create, the size can't be increased/decreased.
* It stores  only homogeneous data elements.

Example:
 int num[] = {3,4,5,6}; //We can't enter any String value in the int. Only Integers allow!
String names[] = {"NAVIN REDDY", "HYDER ABBAS", "SHRI OM TIWARI ",MANVI TYAGI,}//we can't enter any integer value in the String.


ANS 05:

Anonymous Array:-
An array without a name is called an Anonymous Array.
This type od Array is created just for instance use.

Example:

package Arrays;

class Calc{
    public int add(int nums[]){
        int result =0;
        for (int n : nums){
            result=result+n;
        }
        return result;
    }

}
public class Anonymous {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Calc obj = new Calc();
        int result = obj.add(new int[]{5,4,6,8}); //Using here new int[] {5,4,6,8} as an Anonymous
        System.out.println(result);
    }

}





ANS 06:

Generally we use -
*for Loop
*Enhanced for loop

Example:

A) for loop:
 
//Using 1-D------>
String Student[] = {"SHRI","HARI","VISHNU"};

        for (int i = 0; i < Student.length; i++) {
            System.out.println( Student[i]);

B) Enhanced for loop:

//Using 1-D---->
      int numss[] = {3, 4, 6, 7};
        for (int n : numss) {
            System.out.println(n);


//Enhanced for loop Using 2-D Array:

     int nums[][] = {
                {5, 2, 8, 6},
                {9, 7, 6, 7},
                {2, 8, 0, 3}
        };

        for (int a[] : nums) {

            for (int b : a) {
                System.out.print(b + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
}




ANS 07:

length VS length() :

*length is a final variable application for arrays.With the help of the length variable, we can obtain the size of the array.
*The java length variable describes the size of an array.

*length() method is a final variable which is applicable for String objects. The length() method returns the number of characters presents in the String.
*length() methods tells you how many characters a text String contains.

EXAMPLE:

//length:   

     int Student[] = {5,6,7,9};
      System.out.println(Student.length);


//length()

    String name[] = {"iNEURON", "PW the Emotions"," SHRI OM"};
      System.out.println(name[0].length());
      System.out.println(name[1].length());
      System.out.println(name[2].length());
